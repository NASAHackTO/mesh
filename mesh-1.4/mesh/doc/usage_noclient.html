Using Mesh without the Mesh client<br>
<br>

<hr>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
<br>

    The Mesh client is the <a href="usage.html">recommended approach to
    using Mesh</a>.  The client requires Perl, however, thus may not be
    suitable for all purposes.  The only software actually required to
    use Mesh is SSH.  This page details the manual steps required to use
    Mesh with only SSH.  Users should still review the <a
    href="usage.html">client instructions</a> for a full overview of
    Mesh.

<br>
<br>

<hr>
<b>Mesh Manual Usage Summary</b>
<br>
<br>

    The steps below demonstrate how to get up and running with Mesh
    without the client using a bbftp transfer to host1 as an example.
    Consult the link in each step for full details (or simply read this
    page to completion).

<a name="generation"></a>
<b>Mesh Key Generation</b>

    <ol>
    <li>

        <b>On the very first use only</b>, invoke the "mesh-keygen"
        command with the "--init" option on map.example.com to upload an
        SSH authorized_keys file (used <i>only</i> during key generation
        and revocation).  An authorized_keys file contains one or more
        SSH public keys that allow the corresponding SSH private keys to
        be used for authentication to a system.  The uploaded
        authorized_keys file can be an existing file (such as your
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file from any host) or one created
        specifically for this purpose using a new SSH key pair generated
        with ssh-keygen.  The public keys in this file must be in
        OpenSSH format and must not contain any forced commands (i.e.
        "command=").  For example, to upload an existing authorized_keys
        file, the following can be invoked:

        <br>
        <pre>    ssh -x -oPubkeyAuthentication=no map.example.com \
        mesh-keygen --init &lt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre>

        You will be prompted to authenticate.

        <br>
        <br>

        Users who have never connected to map.example.com before
        may need to add a "-oStrictHostKeyChecking=ask" option to the
        scp command line.

        <br>
        <br>

        Note that this is on map.example.com <i>only</i> and that you
        must use the "-oPubkeyAuthentication=no" option as shown.  Users
        outside the target Mesh domain may need to add an appropriate
        SSH option to set their login name, such as "-l username".

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
    
        Start an SSH agent (or use one currently running):

        <pre>    eval `ssh-agent -s` (if your shell is sh/bash)</pre>

        or

        <pre>    eval `ssh-agent -c` (if your shell is csh/tcsh)</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
    
        Add a private key corresponding to one of the public keys in
        the authorized_keys file of step 1 to the agent (this is
        unnecessary if an agent is already running with the key loaded).
        For example:

    <br>
    <pre>    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
    
        Invoke the "mesh-keygen" command on mp.example.com.  You will be
        prompted to authenticate.  After successful authentication, the
        mesh-keygen command prints a Mesh key to your terminal, which
        should be saved to a file in a directory that is readable only
        by you.  This key can be saved to a file by cut-and-paste,
        redirecting standard output, or using the "tee" command.  For
        example, to generate a key and redirect it into a file starting
        with ~/.ssh/meshkey and labeled with the current time, the
        following can be invoked:

        <pre>    ssh -A -oPubkeyAuthentication=no mp.example.com \
        mesh-keygen |tee ~/.ssh/meshkey.`date +%Y%m%d.%H%M`</pre>

        Users who have never connected to mp.example.com before may
        need to add a "-oStrictHostKeyChecking=ask" option to the SSH
        command line.

        <br>
        <br>

        Note that you must use the "-oPubkeyAuthentication=no" option as
        shown.  Users outside the target Mesh domain may need to add
        an appropriate SSH option to set their login name, such as "-l
        username".	

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>
    
        Protect your keys. In order to perform unattended operations,
        Mesh keys cannot be encrypted, thus should always be protected
        with appropriate file system permissions (i.e. 400 or 600).
        Check the permissions of your key immediately after generation
        and modify if necessary. You are responsible for the privacy of
        your keys.
        
    </li>
    </ol>

<b>Mesh User Mappings</b>
<br>
<br>

    <a name="vohome"></a><b>One time per organization</b>, for a user
    user1 of VO1 with an account user1_vo2 in VO2 to use resources of
    VO2, they must specify the home MP/MAP that should be used for
    authentication on the VO2 MP:

    <pre>    ssh -oPubkeyAuthentication=no user1_vo2@mp.vo2.example.com mesh-setmp \
        --home=user1@mp.example.com --homemap=user1@map.example.com</pre>

    This tells the MP/MAP of VO2 that any time user1_vo2 attempts to
    authenticate, it will use any local Mesh keys and additionally
    retrieve the keys for user1 from the MP/MAP of VO1.  This key
    retrieval happens automatically.  Note that this command is only
    effective if the administrator of VO2 has authorized keys from VO1
    to be used for authentication.

    <br>
    <br>
    
    <a name="voaway"></a><b>Optionally one time per organization</b>,
    the user can specify one or more foreign MPs on the home MP so
    that the contact information for arbitrary hosts can be determined
    solely through the home MP:

    <pre>    ssh -oPubkeyAuthentication=no user1@mp.example.com mesh-setmp \
        --away=user1_vo2@mp.vo2.example.com</pre>

    This allows the home MP to determine the MP that should be used
    for access to any local or foreign resource.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <a name="vocommands"></a>Once fully configured, commands to any
    resource can be invoked identically regardless of the VO in which
    the resource is located:

    <pre>    bbftp -L "ssh -q `ssh -Aqx -oBatchMode=yes user1@mp.example.com \
            mesh-getmp host2.vo2.example.com` ssh -q" \
        -e "put /foo/bar /tmp/foobar" host2.vo2.example.com</pre>

    In this example, the resource "host2.vo2.example.com" could be
    replaced with any resource in any configured VO and the command
    would work properly without having to manually specify the exact
    user name or MP associated with the resource (which will differ per
    VO).  Note that the use of the mesh-getmp command is optional, but
    if not used, then the user must specify the user name and MP
    required to access the resource.

    <br>
    <br>

<hr>
<a name="management"></a>
<b>Mesh Key Management</b>
<br>
<br>

    Each invocation of mesh-keygen creates a new Mesh key that is valid
    for one week from the time of generation.  Users may have multiple
    keys at once that all expire at different times.  To facilitate the
    management of multiple Mesh keys, the "mesh-keytime" and
    "mesh-keykill" commands are available.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Mesh-keytime</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        To determine the expiration time of a Mesh key stored in a file
        "/key/file", the following can be invoked:

        <pre>    ssh -xi /key/file -oIdentitiesOnly=yes -oBatchMode=yes \
        mp.example.com mesh-keytime</pre>

        The key fingerprint and expiration time will be printed to
        your terminal.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Mesh-keykill</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        To invalidate a specific Mesh key stored in a file "/key/file"
        before its expiration time has passed, you must have an SSH
        agent running with the same key you use to generate Mesh keys as
        described in steps 2 and 3 of the <a href="#generation">Mesh Key
        Generation</a> section.  After which, the following can be
        invoked:

        <pre>    ssh -Axi /key/file -oIdentitiesOnly=yes -oBatchMode=yes \
		mp.example.com mesh-keykill</pre>

        To invalidate all currently valid Mesh keys, the following can
        be invoked:

        <pre>    ssh -Ax -oPubkeyAuthentication=no mp.example.com mesh-keykill --all</pre>

        In this case, you will be prompted to authenticate.

    <br>
    <br>

<hr>
<a name="preparation"></a>
<b>Mesh Key Preparation</b>
<br>
<br>

    For all operations, an SSH agent must be started with a Mesh key
    loaded, which can be scripted as needed, because the key is
    unencrypted.

    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>
    
        Start an SSH agent: 

        <pre>    eval `ssh-agent -s` (if your shell is sh/bash)</pre>
        or
        <pre>    eval `ssh-agent -c` (if your shell is csh/tcsh)</pre>
    </li> 
    <li>
    
        Add a Mesh key to the agent (this is the <i>only</i> key
        required to perform unattended Mesh operations):

        <pre>    ssh-add /key/file</pre>

        Since Mesh keys have a lifetime of one week, the "-t" option
        may be used to automatically remove the key from the agent after
        a week has elapsed:

        <pre>    ssh-add -t 1w /key/file</pre>

        The will prevent a buildup of keys in the agent, which can cause
        login failure as described in the <a href="#troubleshoot">Mesh
        Troubleshooting</a> section.  Keys may be explicitly removed
        from the agent using the following:

        <pre>    ssh-keygen -y -f /key/file &gt;/key/file.pub
    ssh-add -d /key/file</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
    
        Make sure agent forwarding and batch mode are enabled in your
        SSH client.  The examples below include the appropriate options
        to enable agent forwarding ("-A") and batch mode
        ("-oBatchMode=yes").
        
    </li>
    </ol>

<hr>
<a name="commands"></a>
<b>Mesh Commands</b>
<br>
<br>

    Examples of the use of each command that may be executed through
    Mesh are given below.  Note that Mesh commands must be <a
    href="usage.html#execauth">authorized for execution</a> on each target
    host and transfers to a given host must be <a
    href="usage.html#writeauth">authorized for writes</a>.

    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>bbftp</b>
        (<a href="http://doc.in2p3.fr/bbftp/3.2.0.bbftp.html">man page</a>)

        -e "put /foo/bar /tmp/foobar" host1.example.com</pre>

        Note that <b>you must use the fully-qualified domain name of
        the target host</b> (in this case, example.com) if you are
        not within the target Mesh domain.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>qstat</b>
        (<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/qstat">man page</a>)
    <br>
        <pre>    ssh -Aqx -oBatchMode=yes mp.example.com ssh -q host1 qstat @pbs1</pre>

    <b>rsync</b>
        (<a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html">man page</a>)

        <pre>    rsync -e "ssh -Aqx -oBatchMode=yes mp.example.com ssh -q" \
        foobar host1:/tmp</pre>
		
        Note that even if your home directory has been <a
        href="usage.html#writeauth">authorized for writes</a>, <b>rsync
        transfers to your home directory will fail unless the "-T" or
        "--temp-dir" option is specified</b>.  This is because rsync
        uses temporary files starting with "." during transfers, which
        cannot be written in your home directory.  By specifying an
        alternate temporary directory that is <a
        href="usage.html#writeauth">authorized for writes</a>, this
        problem can be avoided.  For example, the following uses /tmp as
        the temporary directory when files are transferred to the home
        directory.  Make sure that the temporary directory specified has
        enough space for the files being transferred.

        <pre>    rsync -T /tmp -e "ssh -Aqx -oBatchMode=yes mp.example.com ssh -q" \

<b>Mesh Troubleshooting</b>
<br>
<br>

    The following error messages may be encountered during Mesh usage.

    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>"WARNING: Your password has expired"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that your current password has expired
        and must be changed.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>"Permission denied (~/.meshrc not found)"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that you have not created a .meshrc file
        in your home directory on the target host.  Mesh commands must
        be <a href="usage.html#execauth">authorized for execution</a> on
        each target host.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>"Permission denied (key expired)"
    <br>
    <br>

        Mesh keys are only valid for one week from the time of
        generation. This message indicates that the Mesh key used for
        authentication has expired and is no longer valid.  You must
        generate a new Mesh key or use a different Mesh key before
        attempting another operation.
        
        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>"Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that you have not provided the
        appropriate authentication credentials to the MP.  There may
        be several causes:

        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>

        <li>If you are generating a Mesh key and also receive an "Error
        copying key..." message, you have not loaded a private key into
        your SSH agent corresponding to one of the public keys in the
        authorized_keys file uploaded to map.example.com in steps 1-3
        of the <a href="#generation">Mesh Key Generation</a> section. You
        can verify that the correct key is loaded by running "ssh-keygen
        -l -f uploaded_key_file" and "ssh-agent -l" and checking that
        the fingerprint of your uploaded key file has been loaded into
        your SSH agent.</li>

        <br>

        <li>If you have specified -oBatchMode=yes on the command line, a
        valid Mesh key may not been loaded into your SSH agent.  There
        may also be too many keys loaded into your agent.  SSH tries
        each key in the agent sequentially, so a valid key may still
        fail if it was added to the agent after a number of invalid keys
        greater than or equal to the login attempt limit.  Check the
        number of keys in the agent using "ssh -l".  The agent may be
        cleared of keys using "ssh-add -D".</li>

        <br>

        <li>If you have specified -oPubkeyAuthentication=no, you have
       not provided valid authentication credentials.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>

    <br>
    <li>"Permission denied (unauthorized command)"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that you have attempted an operation that
        is not currently authorized by your Mesh installation.  Check
        that the command line is valid and that the attempted command is
        one of the <a href="#commands">authorized commands</a>.  Certain
        options to <a href="#commands">authorized commands</a> may also
        be disallowed, but these should never be needed in standard
        usage scenarios.
    
        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>Permission denied during file access (various forms)
    <br>
    <br>

        These messages indicate that you attempted to read or write a
        file for which such access is not allowed.  The most common
        cause is forgetting to <a href="usage.html#writeauth">authorize
        directories for writes</a>.  Reads and writes of ~/.* are never
        permitted.
